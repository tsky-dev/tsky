tsky is a lightweight, fast, universal and typed Bluesky API wrapper for Apps & Bots. It's designed to be easy to use, lightweight and straightforward to use. It's built with TypeScript and has full type support.

It was primarily built for the [Nimbus Client](https://github.com/nimbus-town/nimbus) but can be used in any other project that requires Bluesky API integration.

## Installation

```bash
# NPM
npm install tsky

# Yarn
yarn add tsky

# PNPM
pnpm add tsky

# Bun
bun add tsky
```

## Usage

Using a Public Agent

```ts
import { createAgent } from '@tsky/client';

const agent = await createAgent({
  options: {
    service: 'https://public.api.bsky.app',
  },
});

// Getting a user from their handle
// First, we need to get the user's DID
const did = await agent.resolveDIDFromHandle(handle);
// Then, we can get the user's profile
const profile = await agent.actor(did);
```

Using an Authenticated Agent

```ts
import { createAgent } from '@tsky/client';

const agent = await createAgent({
  credentials: {
    identifier: "handle",
      password: "password"
  }
});

// Getting the profile of the authenticated user
const user_profile = await agent.user.profile();
```
